# RUBY

## ARRAYS

arr = []
arr << item
arr.join("\n")

## LOOPS

- WHILE

```
while i < n do

  if i == q then
    break
  end
end
```


- FOR

```
for x in arr [do]

  if x == q then
    next
  end
end
```

- diff: for-in keeps variable after loop

- EACH
```
(0..5).each do |item|
    # do something
end
```
